# Project-part1
In this part, you will define your high-level programming language and give some code examples for it. Also, you should write regular expressions for the tokens that you are going to use in your language.

  Our level-high language is called **Eazy**, and the extension for this language is **.ez**. We are using '.' (period) instead of a semi-colon (;) to signify the end of comman line. 

  - Integer  scalar variable - int x, int y
  - One dimensional array - arr nameOfArray[10], arr nameOfArray[100]
  - Assignment statements - Int a is 5, arr name[2] is {10, 5}
  - Arithmetic operators - +, -, *, /, %
     - y is x+3.
     - y is d/3.
  - Relational operators - <, > <=, >=, !=
    - if (y < 5)
    - if(z == 7)
  - While, do-while - phase, do-phase
    - phase(i<100){}
    - do {....} phase(i<10)
  - Break - stop
    - if(y < 5) stop.
 - If-the-else - if-then-else
 - Cin, cout - in, out
    - int num.
    - in >> num.
    - out << num.
 - Comments - 
   - ~ for single line comment
   - ~~ for multi line comment ~~
  - Functions - int myFunc() {}
  - ending token - period(.) instead of ';'
